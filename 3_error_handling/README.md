# Learning Go Part 2

## Creating Error Handling

In this section there were no new commands to be learned/applied. We use the `errors` package and throw an `error` from the `greetings` module if the input is invalid. In the `hello` module, we use the `log` package to log the results and output the error appropriately.

I also created a function called `print` in `hello.go`. This was to avoid redundant code.
